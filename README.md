# ProfileClustering 

A project focused on extracting the right topology of building utilization from raw whole building sensor data

1. Data collection
From multiple data sources (i.e., UTEXAS, MIT, PECAN, IRELAND, GENOME), we choose .hdf5 data format to deal with a large size dataset. All the raw datasets are uploaded externally due to the limitation of uploading size. The transformation process is described in this Jupyternotebook (![alt text])

2. Preprocessing

3. Inner cluster analysis

4. Cluster anlysis (vs EUI, Program)
